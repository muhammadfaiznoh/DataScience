## 1) Medical Cost Analysis

This is my Exploratory Data Analysis on medical cost dataset. 
Analyze by using Data Science OSEMN framework.

- `O`btain data: from Kaggle.
- `S`crub data / clean data: modify value from string to binary
- `E`xplore data: with Pandas DataFrame, Seaborn and Matplotlib visualization.
- `M`odelling: Supervised Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression & Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: K-Means Clustering
- i`N`terpret: summary of findings with visualization.

## 2) Chicago Crime Visualization

This is my Exploratory Data Analysis on medical cost dataset.

1. Obtain data: from [Chicago crime data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2/data).
2. What happened inside the Colab file?

- Retrieve Chicago Crime Data from 2018 - 2020 compress zipped file from Google Drive.
- Download and unzip the file then read with Pandas.
- Rename the column name of the DataFrame.
- Convert string DateTime from CSV into DateTime data type.
- Load the content of DataFrame into BigQuery

SQL script used to get month from date and remove the bracket from location
```
SELECT 
  primary_type
  ,year
  ,EXTRACT(MONTH FROM crime_date) AS crime_month
  ,REPLACE(REPLACE(location, ")",""), "(","") AS location
  ,arrest
FROM `chicagocrime-309113.DS360Dataset.ChicagoCrimeData`
WHERE location IS NOT NULL

```
SQL script used to get hour from date
```
SELECT 
  primary_type,
  EXTRACT (HOUR  FROM crime_date) as crime_hour
  ,year
FROM `chicagocrime-309113.DS360Dataset.ChicagoCrimeData`
```
SQL script used to calculate the moving average 100 days
```
SELECT

  -- DATE_FROM_UNIX_DATE(day) AS crime_date,
  CASE
    WHEN ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY day) > 100 THEN AVG(crime_amount) OVER (ORDER BY day RANGE BETWEEN 100 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
  ELSE
  NULL
END

FROM (
  SELECT
    UNIX_DATE(DATE(crime_date)) AS day,

  FROM
    `chicagocrime-309113.DS360Dataset.ChicagoCrimeData`
  GROUP BY
    day )
